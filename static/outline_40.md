Here is a detailed outline for the presentation on "Module 2: The Art of the Prompt - A Guide for Everyone":

1.  **Welcome & Why Prompting Matters**
    *   **Description:** Introduce the module "The Art of the Prompt" and establish its critical importance as the single most vital skill for non-coders interacting with AI. Utilize the analogy of an "incredibly smart intern" to explain the need for specific instructions.

2.  **The Foundation: The 3 C's of a Good Prompt**
    *   **Description:** Detail the three core ingredients for effective prompts: Clarity (being specific and avoiding vagueness), Context (providing background information, purpose, and target audience), and Constraints (setting boundaries for length, format, and desired style). Each "C" will be illustrated with clear examples.

3.  **Enhancing Your Prompts with Persona and Examples**
    *   **Description:** Explore powerful techniques to elevate prompt quality. Learn how to assign a "Persona" to the AI to elicit tailored responses, and understand the concepts of Zero, One, and Few-Shot Prompting by demonstrating how providing examples guides the AI towards desired patterns and formats.

4.  **Unlocking Deeper AI Capabilities: Advanced Techniques**
    *   **Description:** Dive into sophisticated methods for handling complex requests. Discover Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to guide the AI through logical reasoning ("think step-by-step"), and master how to explicitly structure the output into specific formats like tables, lists, HTML, or JSON.

5.  **The Art of Conversation: Iterative Prompting**
    *   **Description:** Emphasize that prompting is rarely a one-shot process. Learn the value of iterative prompting, treating AI interaction as a conversational dialogue where initial outputs are refined and improved through follow-up prompts, leading to increasingly precise results.

6.  **Practical Lab: Your Turn!**
    *   **Description:** Engage the audience with hands-on challenges. A text generation challenge will involve combining a persona, the 3 C's, and structured output (e.g., creating a workout plan in a table). This section will also introduce image prompting, highlighting the importance of descriptive language for visual AI tools.

7.  **Key Takeaways & Continuous Improvement**
    *   **Description:** Summarize the fundamental skills covered in the module. Encourage attendees to immediately start experimenting and practicing with various AI tools, reinforcing that consistent practice and an iterative mindset are key to mastering the art of the prompt and getting amazing results from AI.
