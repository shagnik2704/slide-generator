---

### **Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

1.  **Understand** the fundamental importance of well-crafted prompts for achieving desired outcomes from AI, search engines, and even human communication.
2.  **Apply** key components of effective prompting, including clarity, specificity, context, and constraints, to various scenarios.
3.  **Create** significantly improved prompts from basic requests to generate more accurate, relevant, and useful information.
4.  **Use** an iterative approach to refine prompts based on initial outputs, continuously improving results.

### **Lesson Outline:**

### **1. Introduction: Unlocking the Power of Your Words**

1.1. **The Hidden Skill You Already Use (and How to Master It)**
    *   Hook: Ever asked a question and gotten a totally useless answer? You're not alone!
    *   Explain what a "prompt" is (any input, question, or command you give to get a response). It's not just for AI – it's for Google, your colleagues, your kids!
    *   Why this skill matters now more than ever (AI explosion, information overload).

1.2. **The Goal: Moving from "Okay" to "Aha!"**
    *   Illustrate the difference between a vague request and a powerful one.
    *   The promise: Learn how to consistently get the results you actually want, saving time and frustration.

### **2. Core Concept 1: The Foundation - Be Clear, Be Specific!**

2.1. **The "What": Defining Your Request with Precision**
    *   Good prompts start with a clear objective. What exactly are you trying to achieve?
    *   Avoid ambiguity: The computer can't read your mind (yet!).
    *   **Weak Prompt:** "Tell me about dogs." (Too broad, countless possible answers)
    *   **Good Prompt:** "What are some common breeds of dogs?" (Better, but still broad)

2.2. **The "Details": Adding Specificity to Your Request**
    *   Drill down into the specifics. What kind of information? How many? From what perspective?
    *   Think about keywords and precise terms that describe your need.
    *   **Better Prompt:** "List 5 popular dog breeds known for being good family pets, along with a one-sentence description for each." (Much more focused)

2.3. **Pro Tip: The Power of the Question Word**
    *   Using "who, what, when, where, why, how" explicitly forces you to think about what you want and helps the system understand.
    *   **Excellent Prompt:** "As if you are a veterinarian, what are the top 3 health issues commonly found in Golden Retrievers, and how can owners proactively prevent them? Please provide actionable advice in bullet points." (Clear role, specific subject, desired output format, actionable advice)

### **3. Core Concept 2: Adding Depth - Context & Constraints**

3.1. **The "Who": Defining Roles and Audience**
    *   Give the AI (or person) a *role* to play (e.g., expert, teacher, friend). This shapes the tone and content.
    *   Specify your *target audience* for the output. Who is going to read/use this information?
    *   **Weak Prompt:** "Explain gravity."
    *   **Good Prompt:** "Explain gravity to me."

3.2. **The "How": Setting the Tone and Format**
    *   Specify the desired tone (e.g., formal, casual, humorous, professional).
    *   Indicate the preferred format (e.g., bullet points, paragraph, table, short story, summary).
    *   **Better Prompt:** "Act as a friendly science teacher. Explain gravity to a 10-year-old using simple analogies. Structure your explanation in three short paragraphs." (Role, audience, tone, format)

3.3. **The "Don't": Defining Boundaries and Exclusions**
    *   Tell the system what *not* to do or what to *avoid*. This is surprisingly effective.
    *   Specify length limits, forbidden topics, or jargon to exclude.
    *   **Excellent Prompt:** "You are a travel agent specializing in budget family vacations. Recommend three unique, family-friendly destinations in Europe for a 7-day trip. Each recommendation should include one activity for kids, one for adults, and a cost estimate (low, medium, high). *Crucially, do not suggest Paris or Rome*, and keep the total response under 200 words." (Role, audience, constraints, exclusions, length)

### **4. Core Concept 3: Mastering the Art - Iteration & Refinement**

4.1. **It's a Conversation, Not a Command:**
    *   Recognize that initial outputs are often just a starting point.
    *   Think of prompting as an ongoing dialogue, refining your request based on the previous response.
    *   *Teaching moment:* This sounds technical, but it's simple: If you don't get what you want, don't just repeat yourself. Change *how* you ask!

4.2. **Analyzing the Output: What Worked, What Didn't?**
    *   Evaluate the response: Is it too long/short? Is the tone off? Did it miss a key detail?
    *   Identify specific areas for improvement.
    *   **Initial Prompt:** "Write a short poem about nature."
    *   **Output (Example):** A generic rhyming poem about trees and flowers.

4.3. **Refining Your Prompt: Getting Closer to Perfect**
    *   Use the AI's previous output to inform your next prompt. "Based on that poem, can you make it more reflective and focus on the feeling of autumn?"
    *   Add new constraints, clarify existing ones, or change the desired focus.
    *   **Refined Prompt:** "That was a good start. Now, make the poem 12 lines long, focus specifically on the changing colors and crisp air of autumn, and ensure it evokes a sense of nostalgia. Do not use the word 'beautiful'." (Specific length, new focus, emotional tone, exclusion)
    *   **Bonus: Chain Prompting:** Ask follow-up questions to build on previous answers (e.g., "Expand on point #3," "Now, rewrite this summary for a LinkedIn post.").

### **5. Practical Application: Your Turn to Prompt!**

5.1. **The Challenge: Transform a Basic Request**
    *   Provide a common, simple task. For example: "Give me ideas for dinner."
    *   Learners will work individually or in pairs.

5.2. **Activity: Crafting the Perfect Dinner Prompt**
    *   Guide them through applying the concepts learned:
        *   **Clarity/Specificity:** What kind of dinner? For whom?
        *   **Context/Constraints:** Role of the AI (chef, nutritionist), preferred cuisine, dietary restrictions, cooking time, budget, desired format (list, recipe).
        *   **Refinement:** After an initial prompt, imagine the AI's response and then refine the prompt to get a better answer.
    *   *Example progression:*
        *   *Basic:* "Dinner ideas."
        *   *Good:* "Suggest 3 healthy dinner ideas for a family of four."
        *   *Better:* "Act as a busy parent. Provide 3 quick (under 30 min) and healthy dinner recipes for a family with two young children, focusing on chicken or vegetarian options. Include a simple shopping list for each."
        *   *Excellent (after refinement):* "Given my last request for quick family dinners, could you now suggest 3 *dessert* recipes that are also quick (under 15 min prep) and use common pantry ingredients? Please avoid anything with nuts, and make sure they're not overly sugary. Present them as a short list with a catchy name for each."

5.3. **Share & Discuss:**
    *   Invite a few participants to share their initial and refined prompts, and discuss *why* their refined prompts are more effective.
    *   Highlight common improvements and creative solutions.

### **6. Summary & Conclusion: Your Prompting Superpowers**

6.1. **Recap: The Core Principles of Excellent Prompting**
    *   **C**larity & **S**pecificity: Be precise about *what* you want.
    *   **C**ontext & **C**onstraints: Tell the system *who* it is, *who* it's for, and *how* to present it (and what to *avoid*).
    *   **I**teration & **R**efinement: Don't give up! Improve your prompt based on the output.
    *   The "Art" isn't magic; it's a combination of these deliberate steps.

6.2. **Beyond AI: Applying Prompting to Life**
    *   Emphasize that these principles apply to asking better questions in general:
        *   To colleagues: "Can you summarize the project status for the client call tomorrow, focusing on key risks and next steps, in 3 bullet points?"
        *   To search engines: "Best gluten-free vegan restaurants in Brooklyn with outdoor seating and under $30 main courses."
    *   The ability to articulate your needs clearly is a powerful life skill.

6.3. **Call to Action: Practice Makes Perfect**
    *   Encourage learners to actively practice prompting in their daily interactions with technology and people.
    *   "The more you practice, the more intuitive it becomes. Start small, be specific, and don't be afraid to iterate!"
