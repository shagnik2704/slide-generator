### 1. Introduction: Unlocking the Power of Your Words (3-4 minutes)

*   **1.1. The Everyday Challenge of Communication**
    *   Ever asked for something and gotten a completely different result? (e.g., a barista misunderstanding your coffee order, a search engine giving irrelevant links).
    *   This isn't just about human interaction; it's central to how we communicate with technology, especially Artificial Intelligence.
*   **1.2. What is a "Prompt" Anyway?**
    *   A prompt is simply an instruction, a question, or a request given to an AI, a search engine, or even a database, to generate a specific output.
    *   It's your way of telling the system exactly what you want it to *do* for you.
*   **1.3. Why "The Art of the Prompt" Matters for Everyone**
    *   From searching for recipes online to drafting emails with AI assistants, mastering prompts saves time, reduces frustration, and unlocks incredible potential.
    *   It's a skill for the modern age, empowering you to be a more effective communicator and problem-solver.
    *   **Teaching Moment:** _"Think of it like learning to drive a car – you know the basics, but mastering the nuances makes you a truly skilled driver. Prompting is the same!"_

### 2. Why Good Prompts Are Your Superpower: Garbage In, Gold Out (5-7 minutes)

*   **2.1. The "Garbage In, Garbage Out" (GIGO) Principle**
    *   AI models are powerful, but they're not mind-readers. They process information based *only* on what you give them.
    *   A vague or poorly constructed prompt will lead to generic, irrelevant, or unhelpful results.
*   **2.2. Beyond Basic: Seeing the Impact of Detail**
    *   **Weak/Basic approach:** "Tell me about dogs."
        *   *Result:* A very general, encyclopedia-like overview of dogs. (Too broad)
    *   **Good approach:** "Summarize the history of Golden Retrievers."
        *   *Result:* More focused information, but still potentially missing specific angles. (Better, but could be improved)
    *   **Better/Advanced approach:** "Summarize the key historical milestones of Golden Retrievers, focusing on their origin and early breeding purpose, for an audience of dog enthusiasts. Provide the summary in 3-4 bullet points."
        *   *Result:* Concise, targeted information, perfect for the specified audience and format. (Specific, useful)
*   **2.3. The AI as a Creative Assistant (Not a Magician)**
    *   Good prompts transform AI from a simple calculator into a creative partner, a research assistant, or a personal tutor.
    *   It's about guiding its vast knowledge towards *your* specific needs.
    *   **Pro Tip:** _"Every time you get a less-than-ideal response, don't blame the AI entirely. Ask yourself: 'What could *I* have done differently in my prompt?'"_

### 3. The CORE Framework: Building Blocks of a Powerful Prompt (6-8 minutes)

*   **3.1. C is for CONTEXT: The "Why" and "Where"**
    *   Give the AI background information relevant to your request. Why are you asking this? What's the situation?
    *   *Sub-points:* Who is this for? What's the scenario?
    *   **Example Progression:**
        *   *Weak:* "Write an email."
        *   *Good (adds context):* "Write an email to my colleague."
        *   *Better (more context):* "Write an email to my colleague, Alex, about our upcoming project deadline, which is Friday."
*   **3.2. O is for OUTPUT FORMAT: The "How" You Want It**
    *   Specify how you want the AI to present the information. This drastically impacts readability and usability.
    *   *Sub-points:* List, paragraph, table, code, summary, pros and cons, step-by-step instructions.
    *   **Example Progression (building on email):**
        *   *Better (from above):* "Write an email to my colleague, Alex, about our upcoming project deadline, which is Friday."
        *   *Excellent (adds output format):* "Write an email to my colleague, Alex, about our upcoming project deadline, which is Friday. **Format it as a concise, professional email with a clear subject line and bullet points for action items.**"
*   **3.3. R is for ROLE/PERSONA: The "Who" the AI Should Be**
    *   Assigning a role makes the AI tailor its tone, style, and knowledge base.
    *   *Sub-points:* Expert, friendly assistant, critical editor, creative writer, historical figure, travel agent.
    *   **Example Progression (general example):**
        *   *Weak:* "Explain quantum physics."
        *   *Good (adds role):* "As a college professor, explain quantum physics."
        *   *Better (specific role):* "**As a high school science teacher**, explain the basics of quantum physics in simple terms for beginners."
*   **3.4. E is for EXACT TASK/GOAL: The "What" You Want It to Do**
    *   This is the core action. Be explicit about the job you want the AI to perform.
    *   *Sub-points:* Summarize, brainstorm, compare, explain, generate, rewrite, translate, analyze.
    *   **Teaching Moment:** _"While we call it CORE, remember these elements often overlap and combine. The goal is to provide enough clarity for the AI to succeed."_

### 4. Elevate Your Prompts: Techniques for Clarity & Control (6-8 minutes)

*   **4.1. Be Specific, Not Vague**
    *   Ambiguity is the enemy of a good prompt. Replace general terms with concrete details.
    *   **Example:**
        *   *Weak:* "Make this essay better."
        *   *Good:* "Edit this essay for clarity and conciseness, reducing the word count by 10% and improving transitions between paragraphs."
*   **4.2. Use Constraints & Guardrails**
    *   Tell the AI what *not* to do, or set boundaries like length, tone, or specific elements to exclude.
    *   **Example:**
        *   *Good:* "Write a short story about a brave knight."
        *   *Better (adds constraints):* "Write a short story about a brave knight's first quest. **Ensure it's under 500 words and avoids any magical elements or dragons.**"
*   **4.3. Provide Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)**
    *   If you have a specific style or format in mind, show the AI what you mean. This is incredibly powerful.
    *   **Example:**
        *   *Prompt:* "Rewrite the following sentences to be more formal:
            'Let's grab a coffee.' -> 'Would you care to join me for a cup of coffee?'
            'I need to finish this by today.' ->"
        *   *AI will then mimic the formalization.*
*   **4.4. Iterate and Refine: It's a Conversation**
    *   Your first prompt doesn't have to be perfect. Treat it as a dialogue.
    *   Ask follow-up questions, request modifications, or clarify if the initial output isn't right.
    *   **Bonus: "Temperature" (for advanced users):** _Some AI tools allow you to adjust "temperature." A lower temperature makes responses more focused and less random (good for factual tasks); a higher temperature increases creativity and variability (good for brainstorming)._

### 5. Practical Application: Your Prompting Challenge! (3-5 minutes)

*   **5.1. The Scenario:**
    *   "Imagine you need to plan a fun, educational weekend activity for a family with two young children (ages 6 and 8). You want ideas for things to do *indoors* because it's raining, and you have a moderate budget."
*   **5.2. Your Task:**
    *   Using the CORE framework and the techniques we've learned, craft a single, comprehensive prompt to get the best possible suggestions from an AI.
    *   *Think about:* What role should the AI play? What context is crucial? What output format would be most helpful? What exact task do you want it to perform? Are there any constraints?
*   **5.3. Example Progression (for instructor demonstration/discussion):**
    *   **Weak:** "Weekend ideas for kids."
    *   **Good:** "Give me indoor weekend ideas for a family with young kids."
    *   **Better:** "As a family activity planner, suggest 3-5 indoor weekend activities for a family with children aged 6 and 8. The activities should be budget-friendly and suitable for a rainy day. Present the ideas as a numbered list with a brief description and estimated cost for each."
    *   **Excellent (if time allows, push for more detail):** "As a family activity planner, suggest 3-5 unique and engaging indoor weekend activities for a family with children aged 6 and 8 who enjoy science and creative play. The activities should be budget-friendly (under $50 for the whole family) and perfect for a rainy day. Present the ideas as a numbered list, including a brief description, estimated cost, and a recommended age range for each."
