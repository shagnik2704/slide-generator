### **Lesson Outline**

---

### **1. Introduction: Unlocking Your AI Superpower**

*   **1.1. The AI Revolution is Here:**
    *   Briefly acknowledge the widespread presence of AI (ChatGPT, Midjourney, Copilot, Bard, Claude, etc.) in our lives.
    *   Highlight that AI is a powerful tool, but its effectiveness depends entirely on *how we talk to it*.
*   **1.2. Why Prompting Matters (Beyond Tech Gurus):**
    *   Explain that "prompting" is simply the art of asking AI questions or giving it instructions.
    *   Emphasize its relevance for everyone: writing emails, brainstorming ideas, summarizing documents, learning new skills, or even planning meals. It's a skill for daily life!
*   **1.3. What We'll Explore Today:**
    *   Introduce the journey: from basic requests to sophisticated, tailored outputs.
    *   Preview the core concepts: Clarity, Context, Structure, and Iteration.

---

### **2. The Foundation: Clarity and Specificity**

*   **2.1. The Golden Rule: Be Crystal Clear:**
    *   Explain that AI doesn't "know" what you mean; it only processes the words you give it. Vague prompts lead to vague results.
    *   Emphasize removing ambiguity and assumptions.
*   **2.2. Going Beyond Basic Requests (Examples):**
    *   **Weak/Basic:** "Tell me about dogs."
        *   *Why it's weak:* Too broad, AI could talk about breeds, history, care, etc. You'll get generic info.
    *   **Good:** "Tell me 5 interesting facts about golden retrievers."
        *   *Why it's good:* Specifies the subject and the desired quantity/format.
    *   **Better/Advanced:** "Provide 5 lesser-known, interesting facts about golden retrievers, formatted as bullet points suitable for a social media post aimed at dog enthusiasts."
        *   *Why it's better:* Adds specific constraints (lesser-known), target audience, and explicit formatting.
*   **2.3. The "Who, What, When, Where, Why, How" Framework:**
    *   Introduce this journalistic framework as a mental checklist for crafting clear prompts.
    *   *Teaching Moment:* "This sounds like a lot to remember, but practicing with these questions naturally makes your prompts better!"

### **3. The Power of Context and Persona (Role-Playing)**

*   **3.1. Setting the Scene: Giving AI a Role:**
    *   Explain that AI can "act" as different personas, which dramatically influences the tone, style, and content of its output.
    *   Highlight how a role provides crucial context for the AI.
*   **3.2. Examples of Role-Playing:**
    *   **Weak/Basic:** "Explain quantum mechanics."
        *   *Output:* Highly technical, potentially overwhelming.
    *   **Good:** "Explain quantum mechanics to a 10-year-old."
        *   *Output:* Simpler language, but still potentially abstract.
    *   **Better/Advanced:** "Act as a friendly, enthusiastic science teacher explaining quantum mechanics to a class of curious 5th graders. Use simple analogies and avoid jargon as much as possible, focusing on why it's cool."
        *   *Output:* Engaging, age-appropriate, focuses on excitement.
*   **3.3. Specifying Audience and Tone:**
    *   *Pro Tip:* Beyond roles, tell the AI *who* the output is for (e.g., "for my boss," "for a social media post," "for a college essay") and *what tone* to use (e.g., "professional," "humorous," "empathetic," "authoritative").

### **4. Structuring Your Request: Instructions, Constraints, and Examples**

*   **4.1. Breaking Down Complex Tasks:**
    *   Explain that for longer or more complex requests, it's best to break them into clear sections for the AI.
    *   Introduce using bullet points, numbered lists, or clear paragraph breaks within your prompt.
*   **4.2. Adding Constraints and "Don'ts":**
    *   Emphasize telling the AI not just what *to do*, but also what *not to do*.
    *   Specify length, format (e.g., "no more than 200 words," "use markdown headings," "include emojis").
    *   **Example Progression:**
        *   **Basic:** "Write an email about a new product."
        *   **Good:** "Write a marketing email announcing our new 'Eco-Friendly Water Bottle.' Include benefits."
        *   **Better/Advanced:** "Draft a concise, enthusiastic marketing email (under 150 words) announcing our new 'Eco-Friendly Water Bottle' to our existing customer base.
            *   **Key Benefits to highlight:** Durable, BPA-free, supports ocean clean-up.
            *   **Call to Action:** Visit our website for 10% off.
            *   **Tone:** Friendly and exciting.
            *   **DO NOT:** Mention competitor products or use overly technical jargon."
*   **4.3. Few-Shot Prompting (Learning by Example):**
    *   *Pro Tip:* If you want a very specific style or format, give the AI examples *within your prompt*.
    *   "Here's an example of how I want the output formatted: [Example 1]. Now, apply this format to the following information: [Your data]."

### **5. Iteration and Refinement: The Art of the Follow-Up**

*   **5.1. It's a Conversation, Not a Command:**
    *   Explain that AI interaction is often an iterative process. Your first prompt is rarely your last.
    *   Encourage treating the AI as a collaborator.
*   **5.2. How to Refine and Improve Output:**
    *   Show how to give specific feedback on AI's output to guide it towards perfection.
    *   Use phrases like: "Make it longer/shorter," "Change the tone to X," "Focus more on Y," "Remove Z," "Give me 3 more options that are similar but with twist X."
    *   **Example Scenario:**
        *   **Initial Prompt:** "Write a short story about a detective."
        *   **AI Output (Sample):** "Detective Smith walked into a dark alley..."
        *   **Follow-up 1:** "Make Detective Smith a quirky, cat-loving private investigator in a futuristic cyberpunk city. The story should be mysterious and slightly humorous."
        *   **Follow-up 2 (after new output):** "That's great! Now, add a plot twist where the cat is actually the villain's sidekick."
*   **5.3. Negative Prompting (What to Avoid):**
    *   *Bonus:* Briefly introduce the concept of explicitly telling AI what *not* to include, often by simply stating "DO NOT include..." or "Avoid..." (as seen in Section 4.2).

### **6. Practical Application: Your Turn to Prompt!**

*   **6.1. The "Prompting Playground" Challenge:**
    *   **Activity:** Divide learners into pairs or small groups (or individual if time/setup allows).
    *   Present 2-3 diverse scenarios (e.g., "Plan a day trip to [local attraction]," "Write a social media post announcing a bake sale," "Draft a cover letter for a dream job").
    *   **Task:** Each group/individual chooses one scenario and crafts the *best possible prompt* using the techniques learned today.
*   **6.2. Share and Learn:**
    *   Have a few groups share their prompts.
    *   Facilitate a discussion:
        *   What elements did they include (role, context, constraints)?
        *   How might this prompt evolve with follow-up instructions?
        *   What challenges did they face?
        *   (If time permits) Run one or two of the prompts through an AI tool live and discuss the output.

### **7. Summary & Next Steps: Keep Practicing!**

*   **7.1. Recap Key Takeaways:**
    *   **Clarity:** Be specific, use the "Who, What, Where..." framework.
    *   **Context:** Give AI a role, define the audience and tone.
    *   **Structure:** Break down complex requests, use lists, add constraints.
    *   **Iteration:** It's a conversation; refine your output with feedback.
*   **7.2. Your Prompting Journey Continues:**
    *   Encourage learners to actively practice prompting in their daily lives.
    *   Suggest experimenting with different AI tools and challenging themselves with new scenarios.
    *   *Teaching Moment:* "The best way to become a prompting artist is simply to *do it*. Every interaction is a chance to learn and refine your skills!"
*   **7.3. Further Exploration (Optional):**
    *   Briefly mention advanced topics: custom instructions, chaining prompts, using AI for coding, data analysis, etc.
    *   Provide resources for continued learning (e.g., links to prompt engineering guides, AI tool tutorials).
